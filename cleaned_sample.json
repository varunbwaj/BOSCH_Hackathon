particular attention to these highlighted messages SAFE DRIVING Safety consciousness not only ensures your safety and the safety of other road users but it also helps to reduce the wear and tear on your vehicle Safe driving depends on How quickly you make decisions to avoid an accident Your ability to concentrate How well you can see and judge ob jects How well familiar you are with your ve hicle controls and its capabilities Safety Tips Always take into account the road con ditions weather conditions vehicle speed in order to prevent accidents Turn ON the side indicators at least 30 meters before taking a turn or changing the lane Decelerate to a safe speed before tak ing turn Do not apply brakes during cornering When overtaking other vehicles watch out for the oncoming vehicle Never drive under the influence of al cohol or drugs If your vehicle is equipped with info tainmentnavigation system set and make changes to your travel route only when the vehicle is parked Program radio presets with the vehicle parked and use your programmed presets to make radio use quicker and simpler NOTE Indicates additional information that will assist you in gaining the optimum ben efit and care for your vehicle WARNING Indicates procedures or information that must be followed precisely in order to avoid the possibility of severe personal injury and serious damage to the vehi cle NOTE Fatigue is a result of physical or mental exertion that impairs judgment Driver fatigue may be due to inadequate sleep extended work hours strenuous work or nonwork activities or combina tion of other factors Take rest at regular intervalsSAFETY 12 Driving Through Water Do not drive through flooded areas Judge the depth of water before driving through it Otherwise water may enter the vehicle interior or the engine compartment If at all the situation demands that you have to drive through water then Keep engine in higher RPM and crawl the vehicle in low gear Flowing or rushing water creates strong forces Driving through flowing water could cause the vehicle to about trying to drive through flowing water Lightly apply the brake pedal to dry the liners until the brakes work normally once you are out of water Driving On A Rainy Day Check wiper blades lights and brakes for proper functioning and condition Check the tyre treads depth the con dition of the tread and tyre Avoid harsh braking and sharp turns It may cause loss of control and lead to a skid For slowing down shift to lower gears and brake gently Keep lights ON if visibility is poor Driving On Wet Roads On wet road or during light showers Aquaplaning can occur Aquaplaning is the loss of direct contact between the road surface and the vehicles tires due to a water film forming between them Steer ing or braking the vehicle can be very dif ficult and loss of control can occur There is no hard and fast rule about aqua planing The best advice is to slow down when the road is wet Night Driving Ensure that all lights are working and windshield window glasses are clean Drive more slowly at night than in the daytime as the visual range is re stricted at night Maintain a speed such that you can stop within illuminated distance of headlamps Do not use the high beam unless in evitable It may dazzle the driver of the oncoming vehicle thus causing an ac cident Use headlamp maindip beam to alert other road users on turns cross roads etc Use side indicators for lane change or WARNING Do not attempt to start the engine if ve hicle gets flooded due to water Tow the vehicle to a safe place Contact a near est TATA MOT ORS Authorised Service Centre NOTE If you have driven for a long time in heavy rain without braking there may be a delayed reaction from the brakes when braking for the first time You have to press the brake pedal more firmly Maintain a greater distance from the ve hicle in frontSAFETYturning Driving On Gradients When climbing gradient the vehicle may begin to slow down and show a lack of power If this happens shift to a lower gear and apply power smoothly so that there is no loss of traction When driving down a hill the engine brak ing should be used by shifting into a lower gear Do not drive in neutral gear or switch off the engine Driving On Highway Stopping distance progressively in creases with vehicle speed Maintain a sufficient distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead For long distance driving perform safety checks before starting a trip and take rest at certain intervals to prevent fatigueSEAT BELTS This section of user manual describes your Vehicles seat belt airbag and Child restraints system Please read and follow all these instructions carefully to minimise risk of severe injury or death Seat belts are the primary restraints system in

following components depending upon the provided safety features in your vehicle The airbag SRS system comprises of the following components depending upon the provided safety features in your vehicle Seat belt Pretensioners Seat belt with load limiters Driver Airbag Front Passenger Airbag Airbag SRS ECU Electronic Control Unit Collision Sensors SRS wiring harness SRS Warning lamp The System is active when ignition switch is in the ON position or the ignition mode is ON Airbags are designed to inflate in severe collisions In the event of a colli sion the collision sensors will detect sig nals and if the Airbag ECU judges that the signals represent a severe collision will trigger the airbags The inflated Airbags provide a cushion to the occupants The Airbag inflates and deflates so quickly that you may not even realize that it has acti vated The Airbag will neither hinder your view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle Airbag inflation is virtually instantaneous and occurs with considerable force ac companied by loud noise and smoke which is normal The inflated airbag to gether with seat belts limit the movement of an occupant thereby reducing the risk of injury When an airbag inflates you may see some smokelike particles The particles are a normal byproduct of the process that generates the nontoxic gas used for airbag inflation These airborne particles may irritate the skin eyes nose or throat If you have skin or eye irritation rinse the area with water For nose or throat irrita tion move to fresh air Also sometimes the smoke can cause breathing problems in such cases it is recommended to get fresh air promptly After inflation airbag provides a gradual cushioning effect for the occupant there after deflates It is not advisable to drive your vehicle after the airbags have been deployed If you are involved in another collision the airbags will not be in place to protect you After inflation airbag provides a gradual cushioning effect for the occu pant

system and may cause serious injury or death SAFETY 1516 Airbag Deployment Conditions When front airbags should not deploy Minor frontal collision Seat belt if worn offers adequate occupant protection in low severity collisions The airbags are trig gered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags Deployment of frontal airbags is not beneficial in low severity collisions Side collision During a side collision oc cupants tend to move sideways There fore deploying frontal airbags in such situations will not benefit the occupants Side airbags and side curtain airbags if equipped are specifically designed to re duce the injuries that can occur in side col lision Rear collision During a rear collision oc cupants tend to move rearwards away from frontal airbags Therefore deploying frontal airbags in such situations will not protect the occupant Head restraints and seat belts provide occupant protection dur ing a rear collision Rollovers collision During a rollover col lision unbelted occupants may float inside the passenger compartment This will in crease the risk of injuries and may prove to be fatal Wearing seat belts provide highly effective occupant protection during rollover collision Front airbags are not de signed to deploy in a rollover as frontal airbags cannot offer any protection in rollover collision When front airbagsside airbagsside curtain airbags if equipped deploy with minor or no visible vehicle dam age The airbags are triggered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags The extent of vehicle damage is not always the correct indicator for airbag deployment In some extremerare condi tions of rough road driving running into a curb or hitting other fixed objects the airbags may deploy depending upon the severity of collision In some of these con ditions damage to the vehicle may be minor or not be readily visible When front airbagsside airbagsside curtain airbags if equipped may not deploy even with exterior visible vehi cle damage The airbags are triggered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags The amount of visible vehicle damage is not always the correct indicator for airbag deployment Some collisions can result in visible damage but with no airbag deployment because the airbags would not have been needed or would not have provided protection even if they had deployed Seat belts if worn offer ade quate occupant protection in such cases WARNING Never use a rearward facing child re straint on a seat protected by an active Airbag in front of it Death or serious in jury to the child can occur NOTE If your car was flooded and has soaked carpeting or water on the flooring you should not try to start the engine we recommended that kindly contact TATA MOTORS Authorized dealerSAFETYCHILD LOCK if equipped Both the rear doors of the vehicle are pro vided with a child proof lock Push the lock lever located on vertical face of the

in such a way that the wheels do not lock when you brake This allows you to continue steering the vehicle when braking The ABS warning lamp in the instrument cluster lights up when the ignition is switched on It goes off after 23 seconds if system is healthy While Braking In case of emergency braking press the brake pedal fully This allows the ABS to regulate braking force and maintain directional control of vehicle When ABS is active driver may feel brake pedal pulsating and very low ABS motor activation noise from en gine compartment which is normal dur ing braking WARNING If ABS is faulty the wheels could lock when braking The steer ability and braking characteristics may be severely impaired There is an in creased danger of skidding and ac cidents Drive on carefully Have ABS checked immediately at the TATA MOTORS Authorized Service Cen tre as soon as possible WARNING ABS may not shorten the distance in all situation ABS system will have the effect of increased stopping distance due to conditions such as gravel pot holes slippery surfaces wet road ground covered with snow etc Travelling on bad road panic brak ing brake pedal may become hard this is due to ABS system taking control ABS will not compensate for bad road weather conditions and poor driving judgment Always drive carefully in adverse weather and traffic conditions Always keep safe distance and ad here to speed limitsSAFETY 1920ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DIS TRIBUTION EBD EBD monitors and controls the brake pressure on the rear wheels to improve driving sta bility while braking EBD provides optimal braking pressure distribution between front and rear wheels to optimize braking distance and to ensure vehicle stability by means of lowering braking pressure increase at rear wheels ELECTRONIC STABILITY PRO GRAM ESP if equipped ESP monitors driving sta bility and traction If ESP detects that the ve hicle is deviating from the direction desired by the driver one or more wheels are braked to stabilize the vehicle The engine output is also modified to keep the vehicle on the desired course within physical lim its ESP assists the driver when pulling away on wet or slippery roads ESP can also stabilize the vehicle during braking and accelerationADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURES as available Cornering Stability Control CSC Corner stability Control supports stabi lizes vehicle during partial braking on curves by reducing pressure at required inner wheel of the vehicle This helps to reduce probability of vehicle over steering during cornering OFF Road ABS Based on wheel speed information off road ABS helps to avoid wheel lock on un even surfaces like loose gravel pot holes by reducing the stopping distance com pared to standard ABS Electronic Traction Control ETC The Electronic Traction Control system function ETC is designed as a slip control system to prevent the driven wheels of a vehicle from excessive wheel slip Roll Over Mitigation ROM The main feature of the Roll over Mitiga tion function is the detection of a rollover critical situation and to prevent the vehicle WARNING If EBD is malfunctioning the rear wheels can lock eg under full braking This increases the risk of skidding and an accident You should therefore adapt your driving style to the different handling characteristics Have the brake sys tem checked immediately at a TATA MOTORS Authorized Service

release of the accelerator pedal due to an unexpected emergency brake situation By actively prefilling the brakesystem the brake response time is reduced and results in a shorter stopping distance Hydraulic Brake Assist HBA In a dangerous emergency situation most drivers dont use the full available perform ance of the brake system because they brake too soft The HBA function detects the critical situation and builds up addi tional brake pressure to reduce the brak ing distance Hydraulic Fading Compensation HFC In dangerous fading situations most driv ers operate the brake pedal with a small or regular braking force and they never reach to the maximum possible vehicle de celeration The HFC function improve the stopping distance by eliminating required pressure buildup lag by the driver Dynamic Wheel Torque by Brake DWTB The main goal of the function is to improve the agility of a vehicle and to enable a more direct steering This is mainly achieved by braking interventions at the inner wheels during turning DWTB re duces understeer tendency of the car and a higher curve speed can be achieved Engine Drag Torque Control EDTC On slippery road conditions during in gear Braking or Shift down of gear or sudden throttle release on a curve road This causes high Engine drag on the driven wheel resulting into brake slip situ ations without any brake application This makes vehicle highly under steerable EDTC controls such brake slip on the driven wheels by increasing the engine torque to makes the vehicle stable and steerable Hill Hold Control HHC Hill Hold Control is a comfort

113114DRIVING TIPS Fuel consumption engine transmission brake and tyre wear are mainly affected by the below factors Operating conditions of your vehicle Your personal driving style Operating Conditions Avoid frequent starts and stops as these actions increase the fuel con sumption of the vehicle Always ensure correct tyre pressure Do not carry any unnecessary weight Regularly service your vehicle and ad here to the recommended service maintenance schedule Personal Driving Style Do not press the accelerator pedal when starting the engine Do not warm up the engine when the vehicle is stationary Always adapt your driving style to suit the prevailing road weather condi tions and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front Drive care fully Avoid frequent sudden acceleration and braking Select appropriate gear according to varying speeds and load conditions Switch OFF the engine in stationary traffic or at signals Keep an eye on the vehicles fuel con sumption Safety systems are merely aids de signed to assist driving You are re sponsible for the distance between the vehicles in front for vehicle speed and anticipating braking in good time NOTE Do not rest your foot on the clutch pedal while driving WARNING You could lose control of your vehi cle if you try to adjust the drivers seat head restraint mirror steering wheel and fasten the seat belt while driving There is a risk of an acci dent Do not rest your hand on the shift lever during driving Pressure trans mitted from your hand may result in premature wear of the transaxle in ternal gear shift mechanism Press the clutch fully while shifting the gears The reverse gear should be engaged only when the vehicle is stationary Transmission may get damage by trying to shift into re verse gear while the vehicle is mov ing Wait for 5 seconds after declutching to ensure smooth en gagement of the reverse gear or shift into one of the forward gears for a moment while clutch is pressed fully This will avoid grinding of re verse gear while shiftingSTARTING AND DRIVINGRecommended Fuel Economy Speeds MT Good Driving Practices Slow down before you shift to a lower gear This helps the engine to keep a lower rpm and result in less wear and tear of the engine components Avoid frequent brake application which can cause overheating of brakes Slow down the vehicle when you drive in cross winds to get better control over the vehicle Avoid high speed when cornering or turning Press the clutch fully while shifting gears Make sure that vehicle is completely stationary before you attempt to shift in reverse gear Drive slowly on wet roads You can get extra braking from the en gine by shifting to a lower gear This can help you to maintain a safe speed and prevent your brakes from over heating specially while going down a hill Tips For Obtaining Better Fuel Effi ciency Always maintain the specified tyre pressure during fuel topups and also before a long trip Vehicle running with low tyre pressure will consume more fuel than the one running with specified tyre pressure Keep the vehicle clean Get rid of the unwanted stuff lying in the boot etc to reduce weight Regularly inspect your vehicle for any leakages worn out wires by rat bites etc Always follow periodic regular serv ice schedule of the vehicle In places with high dust content eg Gurgaon Jaisalmer etc Clean the air filter element at every 5000 km Anticipate the road conditions and drive in a smooth manner Do not accelerate excessively when you are in lower gears 1st or 2nd Be gentle on the accelerator when you are in traffic In lower gears opening up the throttle will increase the engine rpm while keeping the vehicle at lower speeds This reduces the fuel effi ciency of the vehicle Be in the maximum possible higher gear at a given speed This reduces the engine operating speeds which means the engine is running at lower rpm Revolutions per Minute for the same vehicle speed Lesser the num ber of engine revolution
